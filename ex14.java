/*A customer is using a computer at an internet cafÃ© that charges different rates:

â‚¹R1 per hour for the first N hours.

â‚¹R2 per hour after N hours.

You are given:

R1: Rate for the first N hours.

N: Number of hours at the standard rate.

R2: Rate for each additional hour beyond N.

X: Total time used in minutes.

Write a program to calculate and print the total cost for the customer's usage, rounded up to the next hour if minutes are not exactly a multiple of 60.

ðŸ§¾ Input Format:
First line: An integer R1 (rate for first N hours)

Second line: An integer N (number of hours at rate R1)

Third line: An integer R2 (rate for additional hours)

Fourth line: An integer X (total usage time in minutes)

ðŸ“¤ Output Format:
A single integer: the total cost of usage*/
